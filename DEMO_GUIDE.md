# üé• Demo Guide

This guide will help you create an impressive demo video for your Knowledge Base Search Engine project.

## üìã Demo Video Script (3-5 minutes)

### 1. Introduction (30 seconds)

**[Show title screen: "Knowledge Base Search Engine"]**

> "Hello! Today I'm presenting my Knowledge Base Search Engine - a RAG-based application that allows users to search across multiple documents and get AI-powered answers."

**[Show project overview on screen]**

> "This project demonstrates retrieval-augmented generation, semantic search, and modern web development practices."

---

### 2. Problem Statement (20 seconds)

> "Traditional search requires exact keyword matches. My system uses semantic understanding to find relevant information even when the query uses different words."

---

### 3. Architecture Overview (40 seconds)

**[Show architecture diagram from README]**

> "The architecture consists of three main components:"
> 
> "First, the Document Ingestion pipeline loads PDF and text files, chunks them into manageable pieces, and generates embeddings using Sentence Transformers."
>
> "Second, the FAISS vector index stores these embeddings and enables fast similarity search."
>
> "Third, the FastAPI backend exposes RESTful endpoints and synthesizes answers from retrieved chunks."

---

### 4. Code Walkthrough (60 seconds)

**[Show ingestion.py]**

> "Let me walk through the key components. In ingestion.py, we handle document loading for both text and PDF files."

```python
def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    reader = PdfReader(pdf_path)
    text = ""
    for page in reader.pages:
        text += page.extract_text() + "\n"
    return text
```

> "We chunk the text with overlap to preserve context."

**[Show main.py]**

> "The main.py file contains our FastAPI endpoints. Here's the search function that performs vector similarity search and synthesizes answers."

```python
def search_docs_vector(query: str, top_k: int = 3):
    q_emb = model.encode(query).astype("float32")
    D, I = index.search(np.array([q_emb]), top_k)
    # Returns most similar chunks
```

---

### 5. Live Demo (90 seconds)

**[Start the application]**

> "Let me show you the application in action."

**[Open terminal and start backend]**
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

> "First, I start the backend server. Notice the console output showing document loading..."

**[Show console output]**
```
[Info] Loaded text file: dbms.txt
[Info] Created 42 chunks from dbms.txt
[Info] Total documents loaded: 57
```

**[Open frontend in browser]**

> "Here's the frontend - a clean, modern interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript."

**Demo Query 1:** "What is a primary key in DBMS?"

> "Let me ask: 'What is a primary key in DBMS?'"

**[Type and search]**

> "The system retrieves relevant chunks and displays the answer along with source attribution. Notice the similarity scores - this helps us understand how confident the system is."

**Demo Query 2:** "Explain the difference between HTTP and HTTPS"

> "Let's try another query about networking..."

**[Show results with multiple sources]**

> "Great! It found information from multiple document chunks and provided a comprehensive answer."

**Demo Query 3:** "What are ACID properties?"

> "One more - about database transactions..."

**[Show the answer]**

> "Perfect - it extracted the relevant information about Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability."

---

### 6. Technical Highlights (30 seconds)

**[Show stats endpoint in browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/stats]**

> "The system currently has 57 document chunks indexed, using 384-dimensional embeddings from the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model."

**[Show API documentation: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs]**

> "FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation, making it easy to test endpoints."

---

### 7. Key Features Summary (30 seconds)

**[Show features on screen]**

> "Key features include:"
> - ‚úÖ Multi-format support (PDF and text files)
> - ‚úÖ Semantic search with sentence transformers
> - ‚úÖ Efficient FAISS indexing
> - ‚úÖ Document chunking with overlap
> - ‚úÖ Source attribution
> - ‚úÖ RESTful API
> - ‚úÖ Modern, responsive UI

---

### 8. Conclusion & Future Work (20 seconds)

> "Future enhancements include full LLM integration for better synthesis, document upload via UI, and support for more file formats."
>
> "The code is well-documented, modular, and ready for production. Thank you for watching!"

## üé¨ Recording Tips

### Before Recording

1. **Clean your workspace**
   - Close unnecessary applications
   - Clear browser history/tabs
   - Use incognito mode if needed

2. **Prepare your documents**
   - Add sample documents to `backend/app/docs/`
   - Test all queries beforehand
   - Have backup queries ready

3. **Test the system**
   - Restart the server to show fresh logs
   - Verify all features work
   - Check API endpoints

4. **Setup recording environment**
   - Use good microphone
   - Record in quiet environment
   - Use 1080p resolution
   - Record at 30fps minimum

### Recording Software

**Free options:**
- **OBS Studio** (Mac/Windows/Linux) - Professional quality
- **QuickTime** (Mac) - Built-in, simple
- **Windows Game Bar** (Windows) - Built-in
- **SimpleScreenRecorder** (Linux)

**Paid options:**
